    "## What is a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **function is a block of organized, reusable (DRY- Don’t Repeat Yourself) code with a name** that is used to perform a single, specific task. It can take arguments and returns the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it improves efficiency and reduces errors because of the reusability of a code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function groups a set of statements together to run the statements more than once. It allows us to specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to reuse the code instead of writing the code again and again. If you recall strings and lists, remember that len() function is used to find the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task, you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is one of the most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design."
